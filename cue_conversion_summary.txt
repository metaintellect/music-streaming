===================================

- Skipped: 180 albums
- Failed: 3 albums
- Last album being processed when interrupted: CD-80401-The Very Best of Erich Kunzel

### Run 2: 2025-12-15 12:09:28
Log: /tmp/cue_conversion_20251215_120928.log
Status: Completed (but many CUE files were orphaned/deleted)
- Total CUE files found: 308
- Successfully converted: 0 (all audio files were already deleted/missing)
- Skipped: Most files (audio files not found or already split)
- Failed: Several albums with errors

## Error Patterns Found:

1. **Audio file not found** (most common)
   - CUE sheets exist but audio files (APE/FLAC) were already deleted
   - ~250+ files in this category

2. **Already split** 
   - Albums that were successfully converted in Run 1
   - Example: CD-80401-The Very Best of Erich Kunzel, CD-80081, CD-80200, CD-80298

3. **Splitting failed**
   - CD-80085 (Louis Lane - Respighi)
   - CD-80211 (Andre Previn - Strauss An Alpine Symphony)
   - CD-80216 (Angel Romero - Granados)
   - CD-80486 (Tapestry)
   - CD-80515 (Jesús López-Cobos - Dukas) - THIS ONE HUNG/CAUSED ISSUES

4. **No FILE line in CUE**
   - CUE files are corrupted or improperly formatted
   - 100+ files with this error
   - Examples: CD-80516 onwards

5. **sed illegal byte sequence**
   - Non-ASCII characters in filenames
   - Cosmetic errors, don't affect functionality
   - Examples: Files with special characters (é, ñ, etc.)

## Successfully Converted Albums (from Run 1):

From the 136 successful conversions, here are some examples:
- CD-80401-The Very Best of Erich Kunzel (20 tracks)
- CD-80403-Yolanda Kondonassis - A New Barouque
- Multiple albums from Reference Recordings (RR series)
- Multiple Telarc classical recordings

## SACD ISOs Correctly Skipped:

- 5 SACD ISO albums from /Volumes/Untitled/00_esoteric/ directory
- All properly skipped as intended

## Issues to Address on Linux:

1. **USB connection stability** - Main issue causing interruptions
2. **Orphaned CUE files** - Many CUE sheets reference deleted audio files
3. **Corrupted CUE files** - Files missing FILE line need manual inspection
4. **CD-80515 (Dukas)** - This album caused hanging, needs investigation

## Script Location:

Original: /tmp/batch_convert_cue.sh
Backup: ~/batch_convert_cue_backup.sh

## Next Steps for Linux:

1. Use proper USB connection (no adapters)
2. The script will automatically skip already-converted albums
3. May need to clean up orphaned CUE files (those without audio)
4. Investigate the ~5 albums that failed to split
